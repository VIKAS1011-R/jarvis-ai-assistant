===============================================================================

SPEECH RECOGNITION:
------------------
• Speak clearly and at normal volume
• Wait for Jarvis to greet you before giving commands
• Commands are processed using Google's speech recognition (requires internet)
• If Jarvis doesn't understand, he'll ask you to repeat or say "help"

COMMAND TIMEOUT:
---------------
• Jarvis waits 3 seconds for your command after greeting
• If no command is detected, he'll say "Standing by" and return to listening
• Say "Jarvis" again to activate him for another command

TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------
• If Jarvis doesn't respond: Check microphone permissions and volume
• If speech isn't recognized: Speak more clearly or check internet connection
• If commands don't work: Make sure applications are installed (Notepad, Calculator, etc.)

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
-------------------
• Windows operating system
• Working microphone
• Internet connection (for speech recognition)
